The 5 basic principles of legible and extensible *object oriented* design.

### Single Responsibility
A class should _do_ only one thing. Need to connect to a database and log the time taken? Good design would have 2 classes - one for the connection and another for logging. Ideally, you would have 3 classes - the 3rd one orchestrating and calling the other 2. However, it is simpler and practical to delegate the orchestration to one of the 2 classes, or the calling program.

### Open Closed
Classes should be extensible, but their existing functionality must not be changed.

### Liskov Substitution
A class must not be derived from another unless the derived object can fill in for the base object in _every_ case. The derived class retains all the capabilities of the base class.

### Interface Segregation
Interfaces should be as small as practically possible. This doesn't mean one method per interface. An interface should group only _related_ methods together.

### Dependency Inversion
Code to interfaces. Interface separate classes from each other insulating them from each other's changes.

Design patterns are based on these 5 principles.
